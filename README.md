# My AI Concepts

This repository is a basis of my knowledge. I build my AI foundation from a book called - [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems](https://g.co/kgs/Y4Qjtq). It is a wonderful book and I keep revisiting it whenever I have to. This repository contains all the code that I have worked on while learning from that book.

Majority of the work has been done in [Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/prikmm/MLprojects/tree/main/notebooks). 

I have learned or worked on - 
* Basic Machine Learning - Regression algorithms like Linear to Classification algorithms like SVM, XgBoost, Gaussian Mixtures etc
* Deep Learning - Multi Layered Perceptrons
* Optimization Algorithms - Moementum Optimization to Adam & Nadam optimizers. I recently looked at AdaFactor while working on T5 models for summarization task.
* Computer Vision - From AlexNet to EfficientNet Family, GANs and YOLO.   
* Natural Language Processing - I am solid understanding of RNNs, LSTM and am currently going indepth in Transformers.
* Reinforcement Learning - While learning RL from the book, I also watched videos of David Silver from DeepMind on youtube. I have good understanding of different RL algorithms like Q-Learning, SARSA, Monte-Carlo Tree etc.
